Quota CLI for agents - designed with [AXI](https://axi.md) (Agent eXperience Interface).

Agents need quota state before they choose where work can safely run.
Vendor dashboards are not shaped for shell automation, and local CLIs expose different windows, resets, and auth sources.

quota-axi reports local Claude, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Grok, Kimi, OpenCode Go, Qoder, Z.AI, and Antigravity (`agy`) quota windows in one [AXI](https://axi.md)-shaped call.
It is data only: it never routes, recommends a provider, model, harness, credential, or route, proxies, intercepts, logs in, imports browser cookies, or mints or rotates a credential. When the same stored access token is expired, carries a refresh token, and is definitively rejected, quota-axi delegates renewal to that vendor's own non-interactive CLI command and re-reads the result ([Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh)). Default output has no ordering preference. The opt-in `models --sort runway` surface applies only its documented deterministic comparator to quota evidence, preserves all evidence and explicit ties, and is not a recommendation. It publishes one derived per-scope comparative selection signal, [`selection`](#per-scope-selection-signal), as data computed from figures it already reports; the consumer, not quota-axi, does any routing or ranking with it.
The opt-in account-switch orchestrator (`decide` plus the fenced `switch` mutation verb) is documented separately in [Account-switch orchestrator](#account-switch-orchestrator-phase-1); the quota and auth reports themselves stay read-only.

- **Official sources** - quota-axi reads local provider auth sources and calls first-party quota, usage, billing, entitlement, local loopback, or read-only credential-liveness endpoints used by the local agents, with a read-only Codex app-server probe as fallback. The only other vendor commands it runs are the declared credential-refresh delegates.
- **Local first** - quota and auth reports run on the machine that holds the credentials; their network calls go to first-party provider endpoints, never a third-party relay.
  The separate `update` command contacts npm only when the user runs it.
- **Token efficient** - default stdout is compact TOON so agents spend fewer tokens parsing quota state, with `--json` available when a caller needs the normalized model.

## Quick Start

**Credential-source note:** Claude Code and the Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent`) keep live tokens in the macOS Keychain; Linux `cursor-agent` stores its access token in `~/.config/cursor/auth.json` (or the XDG/`$CURSOR_CLI_CONFIG` override).
quota-axi does not read macOS Keychain values until the user grants permission, so Claude quota can stay stale and CLI-only Cursor auth can appear unavailable when no other usable credential exists. On Linux it reads only the auth file's `accessToken` and never its refresh token.
Run `quota-axi --allow-keychain-prompt` once and approve Keychain access with "Always Allow".
After a successful read, future non-interactive quota calls reuse the corresponding account-scoped grant without requiring the flag. Claude grants are also profile-scoped; legacy Claude markers created before account-pinned lookup are not reused.

Default TOON is decision-shaped: `quota[]` carries one fully populated row per measurable scope, and the sparse `exhaustion[]` and `attention[]` blocks carry the finite-runway and non-nominal facts. See [Default report blocks](#default-report-blocks).

`--json` emits the normalized model instead. Derivation inputs are demoted to `--full`; see [Output tiers](#output-tiers).

## Install

quota-axi requires Node.js 22.19 or newer.

**Agent skill (recommended)**

Install the skill in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format with [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add kunchenguid/quota-axi --skill quota-axi -g
```

The minimal skill points your agent to quota-axi's live CLI guidance through `npx -y quota-axi`, so nothing needs to be installed ahead of time and installed skill copies do not duplicate changing CLI instructions.
`-g` installs the skill for all projects (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`); drop it to install for the current project only (`.claude/skills/`).

**Direct use**

```sh
npx -y quota-axi
```

**npm**

```sh
npm install -g quota-axi
```

**From source**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/quota-axi.git
cd quota-axi
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev
```

## Agent Skill

The npm package includes `skills/quota-axi/SKILL.md`, the same installable skill recommended above.
It is generated from `src/skill.ts`; update it with `pnpm run build:skill` and verify it with `pnpm run build:skill -- --check`.

```

- **Live first** - direct provider HTTP calls use 15 second request timeouts, Codex JSON-RPC and Antigravity loopback reads use shorter per-call timeouts, and stale cache fallback is per provider.
- **No first-run Keychain prompt** - macOS Claude and Cursor CLI Keychain value reads are skipped on plain calls until `--allow-keychain-prompt` succeeds once for that source, then future plain calls reuse the corresponding grant.
- **Delegated refresh, never minted** - when the same stored access token is expired, carries a refresh token, and is definitively rejected, quota-axi runs that vendor CLI's own smallest non-interactive refresh command and re-reads the store the CLI rewrote. quota-axi never performs a refresh-token exchange itself. See [Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh).
- **Partial success is success** - one provider can fail while another returns fresh or stale data, and the process still exits 0. Exit code 1 means every provider failed, and 2 means a usage error.
- **No token equivalence** - quota-axi does not claim that one provider percentage equals another provider percentage.

### Human terminal report (`--tui`)

`quota-axi --tui` renders the same redacted report as a live human terminal view instead of TOON: a two-up provider card grid with thin headroom bars and a `┃` linear-pace marker whenever pace is known. It is presentation only and is not part of the machine-readable contract.

- On an interactive terminal the report stays up and refreshes every 5 minutes until you press `q` (or Ctrl+C), with a `Press q to quit` footer hint. `--refresh` sets the interval (30s-24h) and `--once` renders a single frame. A non-TTY stdout or stdin (pipes, CI, screenshots) always renders one frame and exits.
- Live frames paint on the alternate screen and repaint immediately on terminal resize; quitting restores the screen and prints the final frame so the last report stays in scrollback.
- Each live card with a combinable bound leads with the effective-availability rollup (min across bounding windows), colored by headroom: >=50% healthy, 20-50% tight, <20% critical. Per-window rows, including per-model breakouts, are the supporting detail.
- The headline is labeled with the window it actually is: the minimum across bounding windows always equals at least one named window, so the label names the `limitingWindowIds` window (`week`, `session`, `credits`) and changes per provider and over time. Tied limiting windows read `credits + grok build`, compacting to `credits +2` when the names do not fit; a model- or product-scoped headline appends its scope, and any unresolved limiter falls back to the scope wording (`all models`).
- The bar fill is current headroom; the `┃` marker sits at the binding window's `pace.timeRemainingPercent`, the fill position of exactly linear burn. The headline marker therefore matches the corresponding `limitingWindowIds` sub-bar even when another window supplies the finite-runway `empty in` verdict. Fill ending left of the marker means burning faster than the reset clock. The marker is omitted when that window's pace is unknown.
- Pace is shown by the bar and marker alone, never as a numeric burn multiple. The runway verdict on the headline reads `on pace ✓` for `through_reset` and `empty in 7h 21m` for `projected_exhaustion`. Two-up rows keep both card bottoms aligned by padding the shorter card inside its border. The TUI does not display the per-scope selection signal; that signal remains on the JSON and TOON machine surfaces. Those surfaces also keep the `through_reset` vocabulary, while `--full --json` exposes the complete `pace` object. The TUI renders from the complete in-memory model, so `--json` tiering never removes anything it draws.
- A provider whose window relationships are wholly unknown (Copilot or Antigravity, with every window unresolved) has no combined effective percentage, pace, or runway to show, so its card replaces the headline block with a single `per-window usage · no combined bound` line and leads straight into its real per-window rows. Partially understood providers keep the effective-unknown headline. No combined headroom, pace, or runway number is invented.
- Signed-out and failed providers stay visible as dimmed cards and are excluded from the fleet totals in the header.
- Width comes from the terminal, clamped to 80-120 columns; below the two-up width the grid reflows to one column. Color honors `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, and non-TTY stdout (the glyph skeleton is kept), re-enables with `FORCE_COLOR`, and uses truecolor when `COLORTERM` advertises it, falling back to 256-color then ANSI-16.
- `--tui` composes with `--provider` scoping and `--full` (account identity and source-attempt footers). It is mutually exclusive with `--json` and only supported by the `quota` command.

## Output Model

The `quota` command's `--json` emits `schemaVersion: 5`.

### Normalized schema contract

The package publishes TypeScript declarations from its package root, so consumers can use `import type { QuotaAxiResponse, ModelsResponse } from "quota-axi"`. The adapter contract is `ProviderAdapter` in and normalized `ProviderQuota` out: adapters report observed quota data, never rank, mint credentials, or retain raw responses. The narrowly bounded vendor-owned renewal path is documented under [Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh).

`schemaVersion` is command-specific. Additive optional fields do not bump it. A semantic or incompatible shape change does. The `quota` report is version 5, `auth` is version 1, and `models` is version 1.

### Default report blocks

Default TOON is organized by the reading agent's decision rather than by quota-axi's data structures:

| Block          | Rows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `quota[]`      | One row per **measurable** scope: `provider`, `scope`, `effectivePercentRemaining`, `spendPriority`, `runway`, `confidence`, `limitedBy`, `resetsAt`. Every column is populated on every row. `limitedBy` is the scope's `limitingWindowIds`, and `resetsAt` is that binding window's own reset. |
| `exhaustion[]` | **Sparse.** One row per scope with a finite exhaustion point: `usableRunwaySeconds`, `projectedExhaustedAt`, `limitingWindowId`. `exhaustion[0]:` means nothing is projected to run out.                                                                                                         |
| `attention[]`  | **Sparse.** Every non-nominal fact: `provider`, `scope`, `kind`, `detail`, `remedy`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

A `quota[]` row whose `runway` is `projected_exhaustion` or `exhausted_now` has exactly one matching `exhaustion[]` row, joined on `provider` + `scope`. A row with `through_reset` or `unknown` has none, by definition: `through_reset` deliberately has no deadline and `unknown` has none to state.

`attention[]` kinds:

| `kind`                                                  | `scope` | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stale`                                                 | `all`   | The report is stale diagnostic data. `detail` names the last refresh, `fetch failed` plus `state.error` when a usage fetch failed, and any `state.reason`; no scope gets a `quota[]` row. |
| `auth_required`, `rate_limited`, `unavailable`, `error` | `all`   | The provider state status. `detail` is `state.error`, any `state.reason`, plus the retry-after instant for a rate limit.                                                                  |
| `no_quota`                                              | `all`   | The provider reported no measurable scope. Emitted when nothing else names it or when needed to preserve `state.authStatus`.                                                              |
| `unresolved_windows`                                    | `all`   | `quotaSemantics.unresolvedWindowIds`: unfamiliar vendor windows not folded into any bound.                                                                                                |
| `untrusted_windows`                                     | `all`   | `state.untrustedWindowIds`: limits that could not be parsed authoritatively.                                                                                                              |
| `headroom_unknown`                                      | scope   | The scope reports no effective percentage. `detail` names the windows that block it and any finite runway verdict with its limiting window.                                               |
| `unmeasurable`                                          | scope   | Headroom is known but a bound blocks `runway`, `spendPriority`, or both. `detail` names which.                                                                                            |

`remedy` carries `state.remedyCommand` when one exists, and situational agent-directed advice is still prepended to `help`.

Two invariants hold for every report:

- **Every requested provider appears at least once**, in `quota[]` or `attention[]` or both. A provider is never silently absent, and a provider with no `quota[]` row always states its `state.authStatus` - including a positive `usable` - as `(auth <status>)` in its `attention[]` detail.
- **`quota[]` rows stay in provider-declaration order**, never sorted by any metric. A compact table with a `spendPriority` column must never read as a published ranking.

An unknown or stale scope deliberately gets **no** `quota[]` row: the absence of a number is the correct encoding of "no number", and the scope is named in `attention[]` instead.

### Output tiers

`--full` adds; it never subtracts. Default TOON carries the three decision blocks; `--full` TOON adds the `providers[]`, `windows[]`, `scopeAudit[]`, `accounts[]`, and `attempts[]` audit blocks. Default `--json` carries the normalized model with derivation inputs demoted; `--full` restores them with **no renames and no re-nesting** - a demoted field is simply absent until `--full`, in the exact position and under the exact name it has there.

| Demoted to `--full` in `--json`                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `providers[].label`, `providers[].source`                                                                                             |
| `state.refreshedAt`, `state.sourcesTried`                                                                                             |
| `windows[].percentUsed`, `windows[].startsAt`, `windows[].windowSeconds`                                                              |
| `windows[].pace.timeRemainingPercent`, `elapsedPercent`, `cycleBasis`, `cycleSeconds`, `projectedExhaustedAt`, `projectionConfidence` |
| `quotaSemantics.description`                                                                                                          |
| `effectiveAvailability[].pace.behindWindowIds`, `onPaceWindowIds`                                                                     |
| Account identity (`account`) and per-source `attempts`                                                                                |

Everything a consumer branches on stays in the default tier: `state.status`, `stale`, `authStatus`, `error`, `reason`, `remedyCommand`, `retryAfter`, `untrustedWindowIds`; window `pace.status`, `reason`, `reservePercentPoints`, `burnMultiple`; `quotaSemantics.status` and `unresolvedWindowIds`; and every scope's `effectivePercentRemaining`, `boundedBy`, `limitingWindowIds`, `runway`, `selection`, and pace `aheadWindowIds` / `unknownWindowIds` / `worstReservePercentPoints`. `credits` also stays, so a consumer can avoid misreading it as exhaustion.

`--tui` renders from the complete in-memory model, so demotion never changes what the human report draws.

### Quota report shape

| Object                        | Fields                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quota report                  | `providers`                                                                               |
| Provider report               | `provider`, `windows`, `quotaSemantics`, `state`, optional `plan`, and optional `credits` |
| Provider report with `--full` | Also `label`, `source`, optional `account` identity, and per-source `attempts`            |
| Account identity (`--full`)   | Optional `email`, `organization`, `accountId`, and `identityStatus`                       |

Account identity and per-source `attempts` are omitted unless `--full` is passed.
Claude `identityStatus` is `verified` only when Anthropic returns an authoritative account identifier; `email` and `organization` are display-only and must not be used for duplicate detection.

### Provider `state`

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `status`             | Provider status                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `refreshedAt`        | Optional refresh timestamp (`--full`)                                                                                                                                                      |
| `error`              | Optional error                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `retryAfter`         | Optional retry-after state                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `reason`             | Optional reason                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `remedyCommand`      | Optional remedy command                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `untrustedWindowIds` | Optional identifiers for limits that could not be parsed authoritatively                                                                                                                   |
| `authStatus`         | Optional machine-readable local auth usability: `usable`, `expired_refreshable`, or `unusable`. Distinct from quota freshness and from human `error` prose.                                |
| `usageCache`         | Optional shared-usage-cache marker: `fetchedAt`, `ageSeconds`, `trust` (`fresh`/`aging`/`unknown`), and `servedFromCache`. Present whenever the shared host usage cache backs this report. |

When a report is served through the shared host usage cache (see [Shared usage cache](#shared-usage-cache)), `state.usageCache` records how far the served result has aged so consumers can degrade trust: `fresh` under about 10 minutes, `aging` up to about 1 hour, and `unknown` past that. `servedFromCache` is `false` for a genuinely fresh fetch that was also written to the cache and `true` for a coalesced or backoff-served cache hit.

When stale or unavailable quota is likely fixable by a one-time macOS Keychain grant, `state.reason` is `keychain_access_required`, `state.remedyCommand` is `quota-axi --allow-keychain-prompt`, and JSON includes an agent-directed `help` entry. That prompt remedy is offered only when a Keychain prompt can help (`keychain_prompt_required`). A denied or timed-out Keychain outcome is reported as `keychain_access_denied` or `keychain_prompt_timeout` and stays silent no longer, but it does not advertise `--allow-keychain-prompt`. macOS `security` exit 44 is cannot-reach (`keychain_unreachable`), not item-absent: it is not signed-out, and it does not retire the Claude cache.
When no Grok credential establishes usability but at least one still has a valid literal refresh token, `state.authStatus` is `expired_refreshable` and `state.status` is `unavailable` (not `auth_required`). Stored-expired bearers are first tested with a bounded read-only liveness attempt; this classification stands only after that attempt is definitively rejected or cannot decide, and an empirically live bearer reports fresh quota or `usable` instead. The `grok` remedy (`state.reason: credentials_expired`, `state.remedyCommand: grok`, plus an agent-directed JSON `help` entry telling the user to run the Grok CLI once) is a fallback emitted only when neither the Grok CLI session nor Pi `xai` OAuth can fetch grok.com consumer credits, and the same refreshable CLI candidate's `web` quota attempt is definitively rejected. It survives the delegated `grok models` refresh, so it now names the case where that delegate could not run or did not recover the session (see [Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh)). A transient failure does not trigger the remedy. If Grok CLI OIDC is refreshable and Pi is not usable, `state.error` is `Grok access token expired`. If only Pi `xai` OAuth is refreshable, `state.error` is `Pi xAI access token expired` and no Grok CLI remedy is emitted because Grok cannot refresh Pi-owned credentials. Default JSON exposes `authStatus`; when a provider has no `quota[]` row, compact TOON preserves a defined auth status as `(auth <status>)` in `attention[]`. Source-appropriate advice is included only when a remedy exists. Full output shows the attempts: a CLI session appears as a `web` attempt, and a Pi `xai` OAuth consumer-credits attempt as `pi:xai` success or failure. `attempts[].error: credentials_expired` marks a stored-expired credential that was not attempted.
True Grok sign-out or definitive remote rejection uses `state.authStatus: unusable` with `state.status: auth_required` and `state.error: Grok sign-in required` (no `credentials_expired` reason). `authStatus: unusable` by itself only means that no source established usability; for example, a Pi credential-resolution failure instead has `state.status: error`. Callers must branch on `authStatus`, `status`, and `reason`, not on human error prose alone, and must not treat `expired_refreshable` as logged out.
When Pi's `xai` API key (or a still-valid Grok CLI session) establishes model usability but consumer credit windows cannot be read, `state.authStatus` is `usable`, windows stay empty, and `state.error` is `Grok consumer quota unavailable` rather than sign-in required. Pi `xai` OAuth is tried against the same read-only grok.com consumer credits operation as the CLI session.

Claude credential failures without a usable access token preserve the precise `credentials_missing` or `credentials_invalid` error. A usage response with HTTP 401/403 reports `Claude sign-in required`. These definitive failures return no windows and retire the Claude cache instead of masking current authentication state with stale quota.

### Quota windows

| Field set | Fields                                                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Required  | `id`, `label`, `kind`                                                                           |
| Optional  | Percentages, `startsAt`, reset fields, `windowSeconds`, credit-spend fields, and derived `pace` |

Do not interpret a model window's percentage in isolation. `quotaSemantics.effectiveAvailability` reports the effective percentage for each understood scope, the complete `boundedBy` window set used to compute it, the currently limiting window IDs, an effective `runway` aggregate, and a per-scope [`selection`](#per-scope-selection-signal) signal. `all_models` applies to any model without a more specific scope; a matching `model:*` scope includes both account and model-specific bounds. Grok uses the analogous `all_products` and `product:*` scopes.

A model-specific `scope` names the model window or the shared model prefix when multiple period windows describe one Codex model.

`quotaSemantics.status` is `known` only when quota-axi understands the relationships needed for the reported scopes. A non-definitive availability entry omits `effectivePercentRemaining`. Unfamiliar vendor windows produce `partial` or `unknown` semantics and are named in `unresolvedWindowIds`; an empty provider report is `unknown` without inventing an unresolved window.

Cursor's IDE windows (`included_usage`, `auto_usage`, `api_usage`, and optional `spend_limit`) all draw on the same plan billing cycle, so quota-axi treats them as jointly bounding and reports an `all_models` effective remaining equal to the lowest of them. That is the conservative reading: it never overstates headroom. Grok Bot weekly usage is a separate Cursor-account meter reported as its own `grok_bot` scope, so it never lowers IDE headroom and IDE windows never mask Grok Bot exhaustion. An unfamiliar Cursor window is not folded into either bound and does not create a bound of its own - it stays named in `unresolvedWindowIds` and turns the provider's semantics `partial` while the recognized-window bounds remain. GitHub Copilot's window relationships are still unknown, so it reports no effective remaining.

Z.AI's `five_hour` and `weekly` token windows jointly bound model usage and are reported as one `all_models` scope, while the `mcp_month` tool window is a separate resource reported as its own `tools` scope; a tool window near exhaustion therefore never lowers model headroom, and model windows never mask tool exhaustion. An unfamiliar or untrusted Z.AI window is not folded into either bound: it stays named in `unresolvedWindowIds`, turns the provider's semantics `partial`, and leaves both scopes non-definitive because it could add a bound to either.

For every stale provider report, raw windows remain available for diagnostics but effective availability is always `unknown` and omits `effectivePercentRemaining` and `limitingWindowIds`. Window pace is `unknown` with reason `stale`, and each effective pace summary, effective `runway`, and `selection` is also `unknown` with its unmeasurable bounds named. Routing agents must not treat a stale raw percentage as current headroom.

### Pace signals

Each window may include a derived `pace` object that compares cumulative usage to elapsed cycle time using the response `generatedAt` clock:

```text
timeRemainingPercent = 100 * (resetsAt - generatedAt) / cycleDuration
reservePercentPoints = percentRemaining - timeRemainingPercent
```

| `reservePercentPoints` | Meaning                                                                      |

Pace is calculated only from trusted cycle evidence:

- Prefer trusted `startsAt` + `resetsAt` pairs (Grok's provider-reported current period; Cursor's monthly billing cycle, whose start comes from the payload's cycle start or the previous renewal date).
- Otherwise use provider-owned `windowSeconds` with `resetsAt` (Codex durations; Claude fixed 5h/7d; Kimi and Z.AI fixed 5h/weekly).
- Do not infer monthly, rolling, or unlabeled periods.

Every projection quota-axi publishes is cycle-average. There is deliberately no `projectionBasis` field: its absence means `cycle_average`, and a future non-cycle-average basis would name itself.

Default TOON keeps token cost low: `quota[]` puts `spendPriority` immediately after effective headroom and carries the runway verdict, its confidence, and the binding window's reset, while per-window rows and raw numeric reserve live in `--full`. Default `--json` keeps `pace.status`, `reason`, `reservePercentPoints`, and `burnMultiple`, and demotes the cycle-progress inputs those are derived from. Pace, runway, and `selection` are recomputed on every report from `generatedAt` and are not written to the quota cache.

Each `effectiveAvailability` entry also carries a compact `pace` summary over **every** bounding window for that scope (not only the current lowest-remaining limiter): per-status window lists, including `aheadWindowIds` and `unknownWindowIds`, plus `worstReservePercentPoints` / `worstReserveWindowId` (most negative signed reserve among known-pace windows). Different windows keep their own reset horizons; quota-axi does not invent one synthetic reset for a scope. This is factual inspectable data, never a provider/model routing recommendation.

`pace.worstReservePercentPoints` stays a single-window diagnostic and is deliberately not a scope-level comparative signal. The published per-scope comparative signal is [`selection`](#per-scope-selection-signal), which aggregates every bounding window instead of reporting one extreme.

### Effective usable runway

`effectiveAvailability[].runway` is an optional, additive field derived from every authoritative `boundedBy` window using the report's single `generatedAt` clock. It is completion-risk evidence, not a score or recommendation.

| `runway.status`        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exhausted_now`        | A bounding window reports zero remaining now. `usableRunwaySeconds` is `0`; `limitingWindowId` names that bound.                                                                                                              |
| `projected_exhaustion` | Every bound is measurable and one or more cycle-average projections exhaust before their own resets. The earliest one supplies `usableRunwaySeconds`, `projectedExhaustedAt`, `limitingWindowId`, and `projectionConfidence`. |
| `through_reset`        | Every measurable bound reaches its own current-cycle reset before projected exhaustion. There is deliberately no synthetic finite deadline or combined reset timestamp.                                                       |
| `unknown`              | A stale, missing, malformed, or otherwise unmeasurable authoritative bound prevents a sound aggregate conclusion. `unmeasurableWindowIds` names the blockers.                                                                 |

In default TOON the finite-runway detail moves to `exhaustion[]`; `runway` and `projectionConfidence` stay as the `runway` and `confidence` columns of the scope's `quota[]` row, and `unmeasurableWindowIds` becomes an `attention[]` row naming the blocked signals.

`usableRunwaySeconds` is nonnegative and is present only for finite results. `projectionConfidence` is `early` or `established`. Zero observed usage with a valid current cycle proves `through_reset` under that same cycle-average basis. Named model or product windows are additional bounds only for their applicable scopes, so they can become the effective limiting window without changing other scopes.

A bounding window with no `resetsAt` at all has not been triggered yet (e.g. a Claude `five_hour` window before its first request this window) rather than being a data gap. When that untriggered window also reports zero usage (100% remaining, 0% used), it is treated as fully available and excluded from `unmeasurableWindowIds`, so it never forces `runway.status: unknown` by itself; the report's other bounding windows still determine the aggregate. Its 100% can still contribute to `effectivePercentRemaining` as a headroom bound. quota-axi never synthesizes a `resetsAt` or starts the countdown client-side. A missing `resetsAt` paired with any other usage shape (unknown usage, or nonzero usage without an active clock) is a real data gap, not "not yet triggered," and still fails closed into `unmeasurableWindowIds` - alongside stale data, missing usage percent, an expired or malformed `resetsAt` that is actually present, and a missing projection when usage is nonzero and the cycle is known.

### Per-scope selection signal

`effectiveAvailability[].selection` is an optional, per-scope object published for every scope quota-axi reports, including `unknown` and stale ones. It is the primary published selection signal: one scalar per scope, comparable across scopes, providers, and accounts. Consumers that need to distinguish accounts can request the optional account identity with `--full`.

In default TOON the scalar is the `spendPriority` column of the scope's `quota[]` row - there is no separate `selection[]` block, at any tier, because the column already carries it. An unmeasurable scalar renders the literal `unknown`, never `0`: `0` is exact utilization, a completely different claim.

| Field                   | Meaning                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`                | `known` when every bounding window is measurable; otherwise `unknown`               |
| `spendPriority`         | The clamped scope scalar. Present only when `status` is `known`                     |
| `unmeasurableWindowIds` | Bounding windows without usable pace. Present whenever one made the scope `unknown` |

For each bounding window `w` of the scope:

```text
S_w         = percentRemaining_w - burnMultiple_w * timeRemainingPercent_w
gap_w       = S_w / timeRemainingPercent_w
scopeMetric = SUM(gap_w * cycleSeconds_w) / SUM(cycleSeconds_w)
```

`S_w` is the percentage points of that window's paid allowance projected to reach reset unused if the observed burn continues. Dividing by `timeRemainingPercent_w` makes windows on different reset clocks comparable, and weighting by `cycleSeconds_w` keeps a short session window from dominating a weekly or monthly one. The result is clamped to `[-100, +100]`.

| `spendPriority` | Meaning                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive        | Paid allowance is on track to reach reset **unused**, so spending here reclaims allowance that would otherwise be forfeited |
| `0`             | Exact utilization: the scope is projected to finish its cycle with nothing left over and nothing overdrawn                  |
| Negative        | Overdrawn against the reset clock                                                                                           |

A higher `spendPriority` therefore marks the scope where spending recovers the most paid allowance that would otherwise expire unused. At `burnMultiple` 1, `S_w` reduces exactly to that window's `reservePercentPoints`; the metric generalizes reserve to projected forfeiture at the observed burn pace.

Any bounding window without usable pace makes the **whole scope** unmeasurable: `status` is `unknown`, no scalar is emitted, and `unmeasurableWindowIds` names the blockers. An unknown window is never assumed healthy and never treated as zero. A window whose remaining cycle time has effectively run out is unmeasurable rather than infinite. The one case where an absent `burnMultiple` is not a gap is a window with zero elapsed cycle time and zero usage: nothing can have been consumed yet, so its observed burn is `0` and the scope stays measurable.

`selection` is derived per report from the same `generatedAt` clock as `pace` and `runway`, and is not cached.

**This is data, not routing.** quota-axi still never routes, ranks a winner, orders providers preferentially, proxies, logs in, or changes provider quota state. `selection` is a derived comparative _data_ signal computed entirely from figures quota-axi already reports; any routing, ranking, or preference is the consumer's decision. It is also advisory only: it never overrides `runway`, which remains the hard completion-risk evidence a consumer checks against its task horizon.

Optional credit balance data can also appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cursor                 | Can report `included_usage`, `auto_usage`, `api_usage`, and optional `spend_limit` windows from `GetCurrentPeriodUsage`, plus an optional `grok_bot` weekly window from the same dashboard service's `GetSandUsageStatus` RPC. Their effective-availability interpretation is documented in [Quota windows](#quota-windows). Monthly labels alone are not trusted cycle evidence, but the billing cycle is: the monthly windows take `startsAt` from a reported `billingCycleStart`, or - with only `billingCycleEnd` - from the previous renewal date one calendar month earlier (clamped to the last day of that month), so pace uses `starts_at_resets_at`. With neither field the cycle stays unresolved; no fixed 30-day duration is invented. The Grok Bot window uses the sand payload's own `currentPeriodStart` / `nextResetTimestampUtc` pair when present, and is omitted when that RPC is missing, non-finite, or a pooled enterprise allowance. |
| GitHub Copilot         | Can report quota snapshot windows such as `chat`, `completions`, and `premium_interactions`; when the first-party endpoint exposes entitlement but no numeric quota windows, quota-axi reports a fresh provider state with an empty `windows` list rather than inventing percentages. Pace stays `unknown` without trusted cycle boundaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Grok                   | With a usable Grok CLI session bearer or Pi `xai` OAuth bearer, can report the shared `credits` window, optional product-scoped `product:<slug>` windows, the current-period `startsAt` and reset, and optional prepaid credit balance from the consumer Usage-page operation. A Pi `xai` API key establishes model usability only and cannot provide these consumer windows. Top-level `credits.remaining` is prepaid/on-demand balance, distinct from the shared period `windows` credits percentage used for effective availability. Pace prefers the startsAt/resetsAt pair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Grok proto3 zero       | For the exact consumer operation only, an omitted usage float is the official proto3 zero when a valid weekly or monthly current period proves the config is present; quota-axi reports `0` used and `100` remaining rather than deriving usage from money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Kimi                   | Reports the principal `weekly` subscription window (with trusted 604,800s duration) plus every valid self-described limit in wire order. Only a limit whose normalized duration is exactly 18,000 seconds is identified as `five_hour`; future limits remain `limit:<index>` unknown windows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| OpenCode Go            | Declared-window telemetry (ADR 0031, Phase 2). OpenCode Go is a flat-rate subscription capped by published dollar-value windows and exposes no readable local balance file or documented public usage endpoint, so quota-axi reports the plan's DECLARED account windows `five_hour` ($12), `weekly` ($30), and `monthly` ($60), plus per-model `model:<id>` monthly caps ($15) for models the vendor caps below the default. Each window carries `limitUsd`, its `windowSeconds`, a reset one full cycle out, and `percentRemaining`. With no observed spend source, `spentUsd`/`percentUsed` are 0; when OpenCode later exposes readable spend, observed usage folds into these same windows without changing their identities. Reporting these declared windows is what makes an OpenCode account observable, the ADR 0031 precondition for orchestrating it (blind accounts are banned).                                                                 |
| Qoder                  | Declared-window telemetry (ADR 0031, Phase 2). Qoder meters premium models in monthly Credits, and its only readable local state (the `qodercli login` OAuth file) carries no balance while its observed-balance sources both require banned access (browser session cookies or spawning the metered qodercli binary), so quota-axi reports the plan's DECLARED `monthly` credits window at 0 used / 100 remaining with a reset one full cycle out. Plan budgets are Pro 2,000, Pro+ 6,000, and Ultra 20,000 credits, resolved from `QODER_PLAN` or an auth-file hint (default Pro), and surfaced as `credits.remaining`. When a readable balance source appears, observed usage and stacked Credit Packs fold into the same `monthly` window without changing its identity. Reporting the declared window is what makes a Qoder account observable, the ADR 0031 precondition for orchestrating it (blind accounts are banned).                             |
| Z.AI                   | Can report the Coding Plan `five_hour` and `weekly` token windows (with trusted 18,000s and 604,800s durations) plus the `mcp_month` tool window, whose duration is not invented. The two token limits are identified by the endpoint's own `unit`/`number` values rather than array position; any other limit, or a repeat of an already reported one, degrades to an untrusted `limit:<index>` unknown window named in `state.untrustedWindowIds`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Antigravity (`agy`)    | On macOS and Linux, can report `gemini_5h`, `gemini_weekly`, `claude_gpt_5h`, and `claude_gpt_weekly` from an already-running Antigravity app or `agy` loopback quota summary. If only model config quota is exposed, quota-axi reports model-scoped `model:<slug>` windows instead of inventing grouped windows. Antigravity v1 snapshots do not expose enough history for honest burn-rate pace, so pace stays `unknown`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Model catalog and `models`

`quota-axi models [--intelligence high|medium|low] [--sort runway] [--provider ...] [--json|--full]` joins a reviewed catalog of native Claude, Codex, Grok, and Kimi models to the provider's effective quota evidence. It queries those four catalog-backed providers by default and accepts only those providers in an explicit models scope. Cursor and Copilot are excluded from this first catalog because their hosted model availability is plan-dependent; Copilot's quota relationships are also currently unknown. Z.AI and Antigravity report quota but have no reviewed catalog entries yet, so they are not `models` providers either.

Catalog buckets are coarse editorial classifications relative to the current frontier, not scores. They are curated from public provider material and public leaderboards, including [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) as an informing source. quota-axi does not reproduce Artificial Analysis scores, has no runtime Artificial Analysis dependency, and never commits an Artificial Analysis key. `scripts/refresh-model-kb.ts` is a maintainer-only review aid: it may use a private `AA_API_KEY` to suggest changes, but it never writes the catalog.

Every models response includes `catalog.version` and `catalog.provenance`; callers must treat catalog freshness and unmapped `unmatchedWindowIds` as explicit uncertainty. A model row exposes the applicable effective quota scope and provider state. When no model-specific scope is known, the provider account scope remains the evidence rather than an invented model limit.

Default model order is deterministic and non-preferential: provider, then model ID. `--sort runway` is an explicit, evidence-preserving comparator only: finite `usableRunwaySeconds` descend, then `through_reset`, then `exhausted_now`, with unknown evidence last. Equal evidence appears in `sort.tieGroups`; no hidden score or model, provider, harness, credential, or route recommendation is implied. The comparator registry is intentionally extensible for a future separately sourced `cost` comparator, which is not shipped in v1.

### `auth --json` shape

| Object               | Fields                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auth report          | `generatedAt`, `schemaVersion: 1`, and `auth`             |
| Provider auth report | `provider` and `sources`                                  |
| Auth source entry    | `source`, optional `path`, `status`, and optional `error` |

Auth source entries can include `credentialPresent` when a non-secret probe confirms a credential item exists.

| Name                 | Values                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Account-switch orchestrator (Phase 1)

quota-axi owns two captain-editable declarative files for the fleet account
orchestrator (ADR 0031). This phase ships their schemas, a `validate`
subcommand, hot-reload, the pure `decide` decider, and the fenced `switch`
actuation verb. `validate` and `decide` are strictly read-only; `switch` is the
ONE mutation verb and the ONLY writer, the single fence where a decision drives
provider state (via the jcode live-session surface) and records tripwire state.

Limits are observation-driven, so `plan` is informational only and is never
used for arithmetic.

### Files and locations

| File               | Default location                                                                                          | Overrides                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Account registry   | `$QUOTA_AXI_CONFIG_HOME`, else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/quota-axi`, else `~/.config/quota-axi` → `accounts.yaml` | `$QUOTA_AXI_REGISTRY`, or `validate --registry` |
| Declarative policy | same config directory → `policy.yaml`                                                                     | `$QUOTA_AXI_POLICY`, or `validate --policy`     |

The last valid policy is snapshotted to `last-valid-policy.json` under the cache
directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/quota-axi`, else `~/.cache/quota-axi`), `0600`. A bad
edit never overwrites that snapshot, so the mechanical fallback always
terminates. Runnable example files live in [`examples/orchestrator`](examples/orchestrator).

### Account registry schema

Top-level `schema_version: 1` plus `accounts[]`. Each account:

| Field                  | Type                          | Notes                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                   | string, unique                | Referenced by the policy file                                      |
| `provider`             | string                        | Provider slug, for example `claude`                                |
| `label`                | string                        | Human-facing label                                                 |
| `plan`                 | string, optional              | Informational only, never arithmetic                               |
| `cost_class`           | `fixed` or `metered`          |                                                                    |
| `priority_tier`        | integer                       | Lower binds first                                                  |
| `harness_eligibility`  | string[]                      | Harness ids, for example `[jcode]`                                 |
| `binding`              | `global` or `per-session`     |                                                                    |
| `credential_store_ref` | string                        | Opaque pointer into the credential store, never a credential value |
| `captain_reserve`      | window id → percent, optional | Owner reserve floors                                               |

Credentials are never stored in the registry. A key such as `api_key`, `token`,
`secret`, or `password` on an account is a validation error.

### Declarative policy schema

Top-level `schema_version: 1` plus ordered `tiers[]`; earlier tiers and earlier
pools within a tier are preferred. Each tier has a unique `name` and non-empty
`pools[]`; each pool lists registry `accounts` and optional per-window
`min_reserve` floors. Optional top-level `captain_reserve` (window id → percent)
and `priming[]` gates (`window`, `resume_at_percent_remaining`, optional
`accounts`) complete the schema. An optional top-level `priming_strategy` block
(`enabled` boolean, optional `prefer_real_work` boolean, optional
`max_telemetry_age_seconds` number) gates the Phase 2 priming pass (see
[`prime`](#prime)). The Phase 2 model map slots in later as an additive optional
`model_map` field without a breaking change; Phase 1 only requires it to be a
mapping object if present.

### `validate`

`quota-axi validate` checks both files for schema correctness and referential
integrity: every account referenced by the policy (in a pool or a priming gate)
must exist in the registry. Every malformed case yields an actionable issue with
its file, path, code, and message. It exits `1` when invalid, `0` when valid,
and refreshes the last-valid-policy fallback only on success. `--json` emits the
normalized issue list; `--registry` and `--policy` point at alternate files.

### `decide`

`quota-axi decide` is the pure account-switch decider (ADR 0031, Phase 1): the
brain that reads the account registry, the declarative policy, and an
observations file of per-account window telemetry, then emits a versioned
decision naming the chosen account per session and the reason chain behind it.
It is strictly read-only and has zero side effects: it writes no store, switches
nothing, and never touches provider state. The mutating actuation is the
separate later `switch` verb.

Observations are supplied as a JSON file (`--observations <path>`) rather than
fetched live, because a live per-account fetch would require resolving each
account's distinct credential, which is out of Phase 1 scope. The file is a JSON
object with an `observations` map keyed by registry account id; each entry has a
remaining-percent `windows` map (keyed by quota window id), an optional
`freshness` (`known` or `unknown`), and an optional `exhaustedUntil` tripwire
deadline. Optional top-level `now`, `harness`, `provider`, and `sessions` fields
tune the decision; omit `sessions` for a single `all-sessions` decision. A
runnable example lives in
[`examples/orchestrator/observations.json`](examples/orchestrator/observations.json).

The decision logic, in fixed precedence:

- **Tier fallback across mixed Claude plans.** Candidates come from the policy
  tiers/pools in author order, restricted to accounts eligible for the harness
  and provider, then stable-partitioned so every fixed-cost subscription account
  precedes every metered API account. A metered account is only ever considered
  after every fixed-cost account, even if the policy tiers are mis-ordered.
- **Exhaustion.** An account is out when a reserve floor is crossed in any
  floored window (pool `min_reserve`, policy `captain_reserve`, or the account's
  own `captain_reserve`, whichever is most conservative per window wins), when a
  priming gate holds it below its resume threshold, or when a recorded tripwire
  (`exhaustedUntil`) is still in the future.
- **Unknown-data rule.** Missing or stale telemetry makes an account UNKNOWN. An
  unknown account is used only when no known-good account remains, and its
  unknown state is never a reason to switch away from a working current account.
- **Termination.** When everything is exhausted, `decide` returns `hold` rather
  than looping.

The decision JSON is versioned (`schemaVersion`, currently `1`) so downstream
callers (firstmate dispatch-select, the watcher) can pin to it. `--json` emits
the full decision including each `reasons[]` chain; default TOON is a compact
per-session summary. `--registry` and `--policy` point at alternate files.
Phase 1 builds no cross-provider moves and no model mapping; rotation within the
Claude pool never changes the model. The precedence and model-map hooks are
preserved in the shape for Phase 2.

### `switch`

`quota-axi switch` is the fenced mutation verb (ADR 0031, Phase 1): the ONE
clearly-named actuation verb and the ONLY writer in the whole orchestrator.
`validate` and `decide` stay strictly read-only; `switch` is the single fence
where a decision becomes real. It consumes a decision, drives the jcode
live-session control surface to move each session onto its chosen account, and
records tripwire state so an exhausted account stays out of future `decide` runs
until its recovery deadline.

It takes the decision one of two ways:

- `--decision <path>` consumes a decision JSON that `decide` already produced and
  honors it as-is (no internal decide runs).
- `--observations <path>` re-runs the pure `decide` internally from the registry,
  the policy, and per-account telemetry, so `switch` is usable end-to-end in one
  call. The recorded tripwires are folded into the observations `decide` sees (as
  `exhaustedUntil`), so a tripped account is kept out; `--registry` and
  `--policy` point at alternate files.

For each decision whose `action` is `switch`, it actuates the move: the
`all-sessions` scope becomes a single `--all` switch and a session-id scope
becomes a per-session switch. It relies on the jcode surface's drain semantics
(applied immediately when the session is idle, deferred to the session's next
turn when a turn holds the agent lock) and never interrupts a turn in flight. A
`keep` or `hold` decision issues no switch. A failed per-scope actuation is
reported on that scope (`status: failed`) and never aborts the other scopes.
Phase 1 is account-only: `switch` never sets the jcode `--model`, so rotation
within the Claude pool never changes the model.

When it rotates a session off a current account because that account was
exhausted (a crossed reserve floor, a priming gate, or a recorded tripwire), it
records a tripwire ("exhausted until T") to a `0600` store under the cache
directory (`tripwires.json`, override with `$QUOTA_AXI_TRIPWIRES` or
`--tripwires <path>`). `--recover-after-seconds <n>` sets how long that tripwire
holds the account out (default 24h). A later `decide` run reads that recorded
state back through its observations feed and keeps the account out until the
deadline.

`--dry-run` resolves the decision and prints the intended per-scope moves but
issues no jcode calls and writes no tripwire state, because this is the mutating
verb and a caller wants to preview it. The result JSON is versioned
(`schemaVersion`, currently `1`) so downstream callers (firstmate) can pin to it;
default TOON is a compact per-scope summary, `--json` emits the full result.

#### Claude harness actuation (Phase 2)

A decision whose `harness` is `claude` is actuated differently from the jcode
harness, because the Claude harness binding is **global**: one account flip
re-points every live Claude session at once, with near-instant adoption and no
restarts. `switch` therefore applies a Claude-harness decision as ONE atomic
flip, not a per-session move, even when the decision carries several session
scopes (multiple scopes onto the same account collapse to a single flip).

quota-axi does **not** write the Claude credential store itself. The store must
have exactly one writer, and claude-swap (`cswap`) already owns it and encodes
the working switch mechanics (backing up and restoring the live login plus
live-session adoption). So `switch` shells out to
`cswap switch <target> --json` and never touches the store directly. The
`<target>` is the decision's chosen account id, which the operator maps to a
cswap account (an alias, email, or slot number); `--cswap-binary <path>` pins an
alternate cswap executable.

That cswap switch path makes no Anthropic usage-endpoint call, so it adds nothing
to the request budget the shared usage cache protects: only cswap's
`list`/`status`/`auto`/dashboard surfaces poll usage, and those already
self-coalesce through cswap's own persisted usage store.

If cswap is missing or not runnable, a Claude switch **fails closed**: the scope
is reported `status: failed` with an actionable message, never a partial or
silent switch. A cswap handled failure (its JSON error envelope) is likewise a
failed scope. A `switched: false` direct switch (the target was already active)
is reported `applied` with a `claudeActuation.result` of `already-active`.

### `prime`

`quota-axi prime` is the strategy-gated priming pass (ADR 0031, Phase 2).
Priming keeps every fixed-cost account primed - auth verified and telemetry
fresh within one window cycle - because a flat-rate account that sits idle is
wasted capacity, and stale telemetry on it means the pure `decide` cannot trust
its state when routing.

Honest rationale (ADR 0031, critical): priming ONLY verifies auth and freshens
telemetry. It is NOT claimed to advance or reset any provider reset clock, and
no reset-clock-advancing behavior is built. Anthropic's support-documented reset
semantics do not support that claim.

Priming is strictly gated by `policy.priming_strategy.enabled`. With priming OFF
(the block absent or `enabled: false`) there is ZERO synthetic traffic: every
account is reported `disabled` and no ping is issued. When priming is ON:

- `prefer_real_work` (default `true`) expresses a `decide`-style preference: when
  real work is pending, an account that needs priming defers to real-work routing
  (`prime-via-real-work`), so no synthetic ping is issued. The command reports a
  `routePreference` ranking fixed-cost accounts by headroom (most under-used
  first), so a caller routes real work to under-used fixed-cost accounts and
  keeps them fresh without synthetic traffic.
- Only when the fleet is idle (or `prefer_real_work: false`) is the minimal
  synthetic ping the last resort (`prime-via-synthetic`).

The synthetic ping is the cheapest safe call per provider: the provider's own
read-only usage read, routed through the SAME Phase 1 shared usage cache the
`quota` command uses, so priming adds no second fetch path and spends no model
tokens. Its cadence aligns to the shortest window cycle (`max_telemetry_age_seconds`,
default `18000` = 5h) so telemetry never goes stale. The command reports the
chosen `synthetic` call and its safety rationale per provider. The ping never
mutates a credential store, records no tripwire, and never routes or switches.

Telemetry is supplied as a `--telemetry <path>` JSON file (per fixed-cost-account
`freshness`, `authVerified`, `ageSeconds`, and optional `windows`), mirroring how
`decide` and `switch` take observations, because a live per-account fetch would
require resolving each account's distinct credential. `--dry-run` previews the
intended pings and issues none. `syntheticPingsIssued` is always `0` whenever the
gate is off or the run is a dry run. The result JSON is versioned (`schemaVersion`,
currently `1`); default TOON is a compact per-account summary, `--json` emits the
full result plus the route preference and synthetic-call catalog.

### Provider notes

**Claude**

- quota-axi mirrors Claude Code's Keychain account selector: nonempty `USER`, otherwise the operating-system username, validated against Claude Code's safe account pattern with the same `claude-code-user` fallback. Both presence and value reads require that account plus the resolved service. There is no ambiguous service-only fallback.
- quota-axi records the non-secret access marker after any successful pinned Keychain value read.
- When that profile-and-account-scoped marker exists, plain calls read the pinned Keychain value again so an already-approved "Always Allow" grant keeps live Claude quota fresh. Legacy service-only markers remain untouched but do not authorize a value read.
- Without the flag or the current marker, quota-axi may perform a non-secret pinned Keychain item presence check so it only suggests Keychain access when the selected Claude credential item exists.
- In `--full` output, Claude usage attempts identify `oauth-file` or `keychain` as the credential discovery source. They never include the Keychain account.
- When an access token exists, local `expiresAt` metadata is advisory. quota-axi sends that token only to Anthropic's existing read-only usage request; success returns fresh quota, while HTTP 401/403 is the definitive authentication result.
- When that stored token was expired, carried a refresh token, and was definitively rejected, quota-axi runs `claude doctor` and retries once against the store Claude Code rewrote (see [Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh)). `claude doctor` is Claude Code's own installation health check: it starts no session, sends no model request, spends no quota, and does not connect to configured MCP servers. quota-axi never exchanges the Claude refresh token itself; it only checks that one is present, because Anthropic rotates it on use and a second exchange would sign Claude Code out. On macOS a withheld Keychain value read suppresses the delegate and keeps the Keychain remedy instead, because the CLI would rewrite a store quota-axi still could not read.
- Missing or invalid credentials without a usable access token and usage HTTP 401/403 bypass and best-effort retire Claude cache. macOS Keychain `security` exit 44 is cannot-reach, not absence: it does not classify the account as signed out and does not retire the Claude cache. Timeout, network, rate-limit, server, and response-compatibility failures may use only a formerly fresh Claude snapshot less than seven days old that was captured for the same locally selected Claude configuration context (see [Cache](#cache)). Reset-expired windows are removed; resetless session, monthly, and credit windows expire after five hours, resetless weekly and model windows expire after seven days, and resetless unknown windows are rejected. A stale Claude attention row names `fetch failed` plus the usage-fetch error rather than a bare stale label.
- After a successful usage read, quota-axi queries Anthropic's first-party OAuth profile endpoint with the same credential. Its authoritative root `account.uuid` is exposed as `account.accountId` only in `--full` output; if that field is absent, `identityStatus` is `unverified` instead of deriving an identity from email, organization data, or cached account metadata.

**Codex**

- Codex `auth.json` support is OAuth-token only; API key values such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` are treated as invalid for quota usage calls and are not sent to ChatGPT usage endpoints.
- Access-token JWT usability is authoritative for the OAuth bearer probe. An expired `id_token` alone does not mark `auth-json` expired or skip OAuth; identity-token expiry is diagnostic metadata only. A missing or expired `access_token` still skips OAuth and preserves the read-only CLI fallback.
- It may run `codex -s read-only -a untrusted app-server` for Codex JSON-RPC fallback. That probe is also Codex's delegated refresh: the Codex CLI renews its own expired OAuth session and rewrites `auth.json` before answering, so an expired stored token still reports live quota without quota-axi touching the refresh token or spawning a second command. Codex rotates the refresh token on use, which is why the exchange stays the vendor's.
- Set `QUOTA_AXI_CODEX_BINARY` to an absolute executable path when the fallback must use a specific Codex installation. Auth inspection and the app-server probe resolve the same path, and an invalid override fails closed instead of consulting `PATH`.

**Cursor**

- The Cursor editor and the Cursor CLI keep credentials in different stores, so both are independent sources and Cursor auth is usable when either one is. For quota fetching, the editor `state-vscdb` source is tried first because it never prompts; the platform CLI source is tried when the editor has no usable token or its token is rejected. The `auth` command reports both sources.
- Cursor Desktop is not required. On macOS, a CLI-only machine can refresh from the CLI Keychain token after the one-time Keychain grant described below; that quota attempt is named `cli-keychain` in `sourcesTried`. On Linux, `cursor-agent` quota uses the read-only `cli-authfile` source from `auth.json`; its `accessToken` is only a bearer for the existing dashboard RPCs. The editor-credential fetch keeps its historical `api` attempt name. When credential discovery cannot produce a token, an unavailable source known to hold a credential takes precedence over a merely absent store, so a signed-in `cursor-agent` user sees the applicable source state rather than `Cursor sign-in required`.
- Editor source: it uses `sqlite3 -readonly` to read `cursorAuth` values and calls Cursor's first-party dashboard RPCs. If `sqlite3` is unavailable, that source is reported as skipped with `sqlite3_unavailable`.
- CLI source: on macOS, `cli-config.json` holds sign-in identity only and is never a token; its `authInfo` supplies the reported account email, and the access token is read from the login Keychain item `cursor-access-token` / `cursor-user` only under `--allow-keychain-prompt` or an existing account-scoped non-secret access marker. On Linux, `cli-authfile` reads only `accessToken` from `$CURSOR_CLI_CONFIG` or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/cursor/auth.json`; missing, unreadable, malformed, or empty files are unavailable. The sibling refresh token is never read.
- quota-axi never refreshes Cursor credentials, and Cursor has no delegated refresh. Neither the Linux auth-file refresh token nor the macOS `cursor-refresh-token` Keychain item is read, and no non-interactive `cursor-agent` command was observed to rotate the stored session, so an expired or rejected CLI access token falls through to stale/unavailable reporting and requires `cursor-agent login` outside quota-axi. Cursor CLI session tokens are long-lived (about sixty days observed), so this costs little in practice. This is a known limitation, not a silent gap.
- The token value is used only as the bearer of Cursor's read-only dashboard RPCs (`GetCurrentPeriodUsage`, `GetPlanInfo`, and `GetSandUsageStatus`). It is never logged, cached, or included in any output. quota-axi does not call Grok Bot trial, banked-reset, or machine-registration methods.

**GitHub Copilot**

- It calls GitHub's first-party Copilot user endpoint.
- It only sends tokens associated with public GitHub hosts to that public endpoint; host-specific GitHub Enterprise tokens are treated as unavailable there.
- The stored Copilot OAuth token does not expire and carries no refresh token, so there is nothing to renew and Copilot has no delegated refresh.

**Grok**

- It checks two independent usability sources: Grok CLI session auth and Pi's `xai` credential in `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/auth.json` (default `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`). Grok is locally usable when either source is usable, including asymmetric cases where the other source is absent, malformed, stale, or expired. True sign-out requires every applicable source to be unavailable or definitively rejected; `authStatus: unusable` can also accompany an indeterminate local credential-resolution failure, but that failure remains `state.status: error` rather than `auth_required`.
- Grok CLI session-scoped auth and Pi `xai` OAuth are eligible, read-only, for Grok's consumer `grok_api_v2.GrokBuildBilling.GetGrokCreditsConfig` operation. The CLI source is attempted first; its success makes a Pi request unnecessary, while its failure does not prevent trying Pi OAuth. CLI session-scoped entries are preferred over API-key entries. Observed Grok CLI OIDC access tokens are short-lived (about six hours on current CLI sessions) while a refresh token remains present for CLI-owned recovery.
- Session-scoped Grok auth includes web/session scopes and OIDC records scoped to `auth.x.ai` with `auth_mode` or `authMode` set to `oidc`, including scope keys with `::<client id>` suffixes.
- Pi `xai` auth follows Pi's auth-file contract: `type: "oauth"` with literal `access` / optional `refresh` / `expires`, or `type: "api_key"` with a literal `key`. Environment, template, and command references are not resolved. Ambient `XAI_API_KEY` is not a quota-axi credential source. A locally usable Pi OAuth access token is sent as the bearer of the same read-only grok.com consumer credits request as the Grok CLI session. A Pi API key establishes model usability only (`authStatus: usable` with empty windows when it cannot expose consumer quota), not grok.com credits.
- The Grok CLI owns OIDC access-token refresh and rewrites `~/.grok/auth.json`; Pi owns refresh of its own `auth.json` OAuth entries. quota-axi never exchanges a refresh token, launches an agent session, or writes either auth file. Expired-session classification and recovery fields are documented under [Provider `state`](#provider-state).
- When the Grok CLI session was stored-expired, carries a refresh token, and grok.com definitively rejected it, quota-axi runs `grok models` and retries once against the file the CLI rewrote (see [Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh)). `grok models` prints the account's model list and exits: it starts no agent, opens no TUI, and spends no model quota. The delegate is skipped for a relocated store (`GROK_AUTH`, `GROK_AUTH_JSON`, `GROK_AUTH_PATH`), because the CLI would rotate its own default file instead. Pi's `xai` entry has no delegated refresh: no non-interactive Pi command was observed to renew it, so it stays read-only.
- Stored expiry is advisory, never a verdict. Shared credential selection (`src/providers/credential-selection.ts`) tries stored-valid credentials first, then, instead of declaring Grok expired, empirically tests stored-expired ones: an expired Grok CLI session bearer and an expired Pi `xai` OAuth bearer are each offered to the same read-only grok.com consumer operation (the fetch doubles as the liveness probe). An empirically live credential wins with fresh consumer quota, so Grok is never reported expired or signed out while a readable consumer bearer verifiably works.
- Only HTTP 401/403 and auth-class gRPC codes are definitive rejection. A transient network/rate-limit failure never switches candidates within one credential source and never becomes an auth verdict (the stored classification stands), but it does not prevent trying the other independent source. Such failures remain stale-cache eligible for same-source web snapshots.
- It does not send browser cookies, perform OAuth, exchange a refresh token, retain raw response bodies, or derive usage from monetary fields. The only Grok process it ever starts is the declared `grok models` refresh delegate.

**Kimi**

- It opens Pi's `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/auth.json` (default `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`) read-only with a strict 64 KiB cap and guaranteed descriptor cleanup. It accepts only the exact `kimi-coding` entry, either `type: "api_key"` with a nonempty, control-byte-free literal string `key`, or `type: "oauth"` with such an `access` token whose optional `expires` is still in the future; any other type is unsupported, an expired OAuth record is reported as expired (with whether a refresh token exists) and never refreshed, and malformed or oversized files, unsafe shapes, and environment, template, or command references are unavailable without resolving or executing their values. Auth and quota inspection do not create, rewrite, or otherwise manage Pi provider state.
- If Pi has no supported credential, it reads the official Kimi Code CLI credential at `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/credentials/kimi-code.json`, defaulting to `$HOME/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`. It accepts only a non-empty `access_token` whose Unix-seconds `expires_at` (a JSON number or numeric string) is more than 60 seconds in the future.
- The Pi source always has priority. Ambient API-key environment variables are not a credential source. Transport, decoding, timeout, cancellation, and server failures do not trigger credential switching.
- It sends one redirect-disabled `GET` to the fixed `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages` endpoint with a 15 second total deadline and a 262,144-byte decoded-body cap.
- It never uses `refresh_token`, accepts a custom Kimi origin, launches Pi or Kimi, makes a model request, refreshes or writes credentials, creates a device ID, imports cookies, sends device identity, retains raw responses, or exposes account, plan, token, or fingerprint data. Kimi has no delegated refresh: no non-interactive Pi or Kimi Code CLI command was established as renewing either store, so an expired record stays read-only with honest advice.
- Definitive credential absence or rejection retires Kimi cache data. Transient fallback drops reset-expired windows and applies five-hour or seven-day age bounds to windows without resets.

**OpenCode Go**

- It reads the `opencode` entry from OpenCode's `auth.json` in place, honoring the same `OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT` inline override OpenCode itself supports. A present `api`/`wellknown` key or an unexpired `oauth` access token makes the account usable; an `oauth` record whose `expires` epoch is past resolves as `expired_refreshable` (soft expiry, never refreshed here), and an absent entry is `auth_required` with `authStatus: unusable`.
- It never sends the credential anywhere. There is no OpenCode usage/balance request: the plan's dollar-value windows are declared static telemetry, not fetched, so the credential's only role is proving the account is signed in.
- Windows are declared, not observed. Because no readable spend source exists, every window reports 0 used / 100 remaining with a reset one full cycle out. When OpenCode later exposes readable spend, observed usage should fold into `spentUsd`/`percentUsed` on these same window identities without renaming them.

**Qoder**

- It reads the `qodercli login` OAuth credential from `~/.qoder/.auth/user` in place, honoring the `QODER_AUTH_CONTENT` inline override and the `QODER_AUTH_JSON` / `QODER_HOME` path overrides. A present `accessToken`/`access_token` with an unexpired `expiresAt`/`expires_at` makes the account usable; a past-expiry record resolves as `expired_refreshable` (soft expiry, never refreshed here), and an absent entry is `auth_required` with `authStatus: unusable`.
- It never sends the credential anywhere. There is no Qoder usage/balance request: Qoder's observed-balance sources both require access quota-axi will not take. The `GET /api/v2/me/usages/big_model_credits` dashboard endpoint authenticates with imported browser session cookies, and the qodercli SDK `getUsage()` requires spawning the metered qodercli binary. Importing browser cookies and launching a provider CLI are both banned, so the credential's only role is to confirm sign-in.
- The plan's declared monthly premium-model credit budget (Pro 2,000, Pro+ 6,000, Ultra 20,000) is reported as one static `monthly` credits window at 0 used / 100 remaining with a reset one full cycle out, and echoed as `credits.remaining`. The plan is resolved from `QODER_PLAN` first, then an auth-file `subscriptionType`/`userType` hint, defaulting to Pro. When a readable balance source appears, fold observed usage and stacked Credit Packs into the SAME `monthly` window rather than renaming it.

**Z.AI**

- It reads opencode's `auth.json` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json` when set, otherwise `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`; `%LOCALAPPDATA%\opencode\auth.json` on Windows) and accepts only a nonempty, control-byte-free literal string key under a known Coding Plan provider id, taken from `key`, `apiKey`, `api_key`, `token`, `accessToken`, or `auth_token`, or from a bare string entry. Environment, template, and command references are not resolved or executed, so an entry that holds one is treated as no credential rather than sent as a header value. quota-axi never writes or manages opencode state.
- The `zai-coding-plan`, `zai`, `z-ai`, and `z.ai` ids resolve to `api.z.ai`, and `zhipu` / `zhipuai` resolve to `open.bigmodel.cn`; ambient API-key environment variables are not a credential source.
- It sends one redirect-disabled `GET` to that host's `/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit` with the key in a bare `Authorization` header (no `Bearer` prefix), a 15 second total deadline, and a 262,144-byte decoded-body cap. The endpoint is undocumented, so normalization is deliberately schema-tolerant rather than positional.
- Definitive credential absence, an unparseable credential file, and HTTP 401/403 retire Z.AI cache data. An auth file that exists but cannot be read is an indeterminate local failure rather than a sign-out, so it reports `state.status: error` and stays cache-eligible. Timeout, network, 408, 429, 5xx, oversized-response, and unreadable-auth-file failures may reuse a formerly fresh snapshot with reset-expired windows removed and, for windows without a reset, five-hour, seven-day, or thirty-day age bounds by window kind; a resetless untrusted unknown window has no age bound of its own and is dropped.
- It never launches opencode, refreshes or writes credentials, sends cookies, retains raw responses, or exposes the account's key or plan identity beyond the plan label the endpoint reports. The Coding Plan key does not expire, so there is nothing to renew and Z.AI has no delegated refresh.

**Antigravity**

- It never launches, restarts, signs in to, or mutates Antigravity or `agy`. It reads no credential store, so it has no delegated refresh either.
- On macOS and Linux, it discovers only the current user's processes and their owned listening ports, then sends read-only POST requests with operation-specific bodies to local endpoints on `127.0.0.1`. An app-advertised extension port is eligible only when the same process owns its listener.
- It prefers `RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` with `forceRefresh: false`, uses `GetUserStatus` for plan identity and account identity exposed only behind `--full`, and can fall back to model quota data from `GetUserStatus` / `GetCommandModelConfigs` when grouped quota summary is unavailable.
- Percent remaining and reset times come only from vendor `remainingFraction`/`resetTime` fields. It does not invent windows, resets, or percentages.
- Burn rate is not reported for Antigravity v1 because the local payload exposes point-in-time quota snapshots, not enough history to compute a rate honestly.

### Delegated credential refresh

quota-axi reports quota; it is not an auth app. It never mints a credential, never rotates one, and never performs a refresh-token exchange over HTTP. Those refresh tokens rotate on use, so a second holder performing the exchange would spend the vendor's own single-use token and sign the user out of the harness being measured.

Instead, when the same stored access token is expired, carries a refresh token, **and** is definitively rejected, quota-axi runs the vendor CLI's own smallest non-interactive command that already owns rotation, then re-reads the store that CLI rewrote and retries the same read-only quota request once. Rotation is always the vendor's; quota-axi only reads the result.

| Provider                                        | Vendor-owned recovery path        | Store the vendor rewrites                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude                                          | `claude doctor` delegate          | the Claude Code Keychain item, or `.credentials.json` |
| Codex                                           | existing `app-server` quota probe | `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`                               |
| Grok                                            | `grok models` delegate            | `$GROK_HOME/auth.json`                                |
| Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Kimi, Z.AI, Antigravity | none                              | read-only; see the per-provider notes below           |

The Claude and Grok delegated runs are bounded the same way:

- Fixed argv declared in this repository, resolved through `PATH` (or a provider's absolute binary override), never through a shell and never assembled from provider responses, configuration, or user input.
- No interactive surface: the child gets no stdin, so a vendor command that would prompt exits instead of waiting; `TERM=dumb`, `NO_COLOR=1`, and the vendors' own `NO_BROWSER` / `NO_OPEN_BROWSER` opt-outs are forced. No delegate opens a browser, starts a session, or spends the quota being measured.
- A wall-clock budget with SIGTERM/SIGKILL teardown, and at most one delegated refresh per credential source per quota read. That bound is per read rather than per process, so a long-running `--tui` still recovers from a session that expires while it is up.
- Vendor output is drained and discarded. A credential is never parsed out of a vendor's stdout; the refreshed value only ever comes from re-reading the vendor's own store.
- It runs only for soft expiry: a stored-expired credential that carries a refresh token and was definitively rejected. Transient failures, missing or malformed stores, stored-valid credentials the server revoked, and relocated stores the vendor would not rewrite all stay read-only.
- `--no-credential-refresh` disables it entirely, and the read-only `auth` command never delegates a refresh.

A Claude or Grok delegated run appears in `--full` output as its own attempt (`claude-cli-refresh`, `grok-cli-refresh`), with `status: "skipped"` and `error: "refresh_command_not_found"` when the vendor CLI is not installed. On Windows, delegated refresh may not run when the vendor CLI resolves to a `.cmd` or `.bat` command shim, because quota-axi deliberately never invokes a shell. In that case it records the failed refresh attempt and continues with normal read-only failure reporting and any applicable advice. Quota accuracy and the no-shell safety guarantee are unchanged. Codex needs no extra spawn: its existing read-only `cli-rpc` app-server probe both refreshes `auth.json` and returns the rate limits, so an expired Codex token already reports live quota through the vendor CLI.

Providers with no established non-interactive rotation command stay read-only on purpose. That is a documented limitation rather than a reason to force an unsafe path: Cursor's CLI token is long-lived and no non-interactive `cursor-agent` command was observed to rotate it, GitHub Copilot's stored OAuth token does not expire, Z.AI uses a non-expiring API key, Pi-owned OAuth entries (`xai`, `kimi-coding`) have no non-interactive Pi refresh command, and Antigravity exposes no credential store at all.

### Safety guarantees

- Quota and auth HTTP requests go only to first-party provider usage, quota, billing, entitlement, or read-only credential-liveness endpoints with the user's local credentials; Antigravity requests stay on 127.0.0.1 loopback.
- The user-initiated `update` command is the only outbound non-provider network surface, and it is not part of quota measurement.
- It sends credential values only to the first-party provider request they authenticate.
- It never prints, logs, or caches credential values.
- It never mints, rotates, or writes a credential, and never performs a refresh-token exchange. Credential renewal is always delegated to the vendor CLI that owns the store (see [Delegated credential refresh](#delegated-credential-refresh)).
- It never reads a refresh token's value. Only its presence is checked, as evidence that the vendor can still recover.
- It never launches the Cursor, Pi, Kimi, opencode, or Antigravity/`agy` CLIs. It runs only the declared read-only Codex app-server probe and the two declared refresh delegates (`claude doctor`, `grok models`), none of which starts a session or spends the quota being measured.
- It never routes, ranks a winner, or orders providers preferentially. Derived comparative signals, including `effectiveAvailability[].selection`, are published as data for the consumer to act on.

### Shared usage cache

A separate read-through layer coalesces upstream usage fetches across the whole host so many concurrent callers (any jcode session, any quota-axi invocation) do not each poll a provider's usage endpoint independently and trigger `429` rate limits.

| TTL                 | A stored payload is served without any upstream fetch for about five minutes.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `429` handling      | A rate limit serves the last payload and honors a returned `Retry-After`; absent that, exponential backoff with equal jitter (default first backoff about fifteen minutes). It never retries into a storm.                                |
| Age marker          | Served results carry `state.usageCache` (`fetchedAt`, `ageSeconds`, `trust` of `fresh`/`aging`/`unknown` at about ten minutes and one hour, `servedFromCache`) so consumers age-degrade trust.                                            |
| Contents and safety | Records use `0600` permissions and hold only the normalized non-secret snapshot, never account identity, source attempts, or raw provider responses. A cache I/O failure falls back to a direct provider fetch and never blocks a report. |

## Development

## Fork improvements

This fork ([yjuyjuy/quota-axi](https://github.com/yjuyjuy/quota-axi)) extends upstream ([kunchenguid/quota-axi](https://github.com/kunchenguid/quota-axi)) with the following.

- **Account-switch orchestrator** adds a captain-editable **registry and declarative policy** with a hot-reloading `validate` command, so account rules live in reviewed YAML.
- **Pure account-switch decider** exposes a side-effect-free `decide` command that names the account per session with a full reason chain.
- **Fenced `switch` verb** is the one mutation path, actuating jcode live sessions with drain semantics, tripwires, and a `--dry-run` guard.
- **Strategy-gated priming** keeps fixed-cost accounts authenticated and telemetry-fresh through the `prime` command, issuing zero synthetic pings when disabled.
- **Shared single-flight usage cache** coalesces callers to about one upstream fetch per provider per TTL, with backoff and age-degraded trust.
- **OpenCode Go provider** reports its declared dollar-value quota windows so a signed-in OpenCode plan shows up in every report.
